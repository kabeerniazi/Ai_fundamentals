# 🚀 Kabeer's AI Course: Your AI Launchpad

Welcome! You've found your starting point for a grand tour of Artificial Intelligence. This course, curated by Kabeer and developed with Kai, is a complete journey from the absolute basics of programming to building sophisticated AI models that can recommend movies, detect anomalies, and more.

Think of this repository as your personal AI gym. Each module is a new workout designed to build your skills, intuition, and confidence. Let's get started!

## The Curriculum: Your Roadmap to Mastery

The course is broken down into two major parts, taking you from understanding the data you have (Supervised Learning) to finding patterns in data you don't understand yet (Unsupervised Learning).

### Part 1: Supervised Learning 🎯

* **Module 1:** 🧠 AI Fundamentals with Python & NumPy
* **Module 2:** 📈 Linear Regression with One Variable
* **Module 3:** 📊 Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
* **Module 4:** ✅ Logistic Regression for Classification
* **Module 5:** 🤖 Neural Network Foundations
* **Module 6:** ⚙️ Neural Network Training & Architecture
* **Module 7:** 🏆 Best Practices for Model Development
* **Module 8:** 🌳 Tree-Based Models

### Part 2: Unsupervised Learning & Recommender Systems 🎬

* **Module 9:** 🔍 Clustering and Anomaly Detection
* **Module 10:** 🍿 Recommender Systems

## Ready, Set, Code: How to Get Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Get your own copy of the course materials.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kabeerniazi/Ai_fundamentals
    cd Ai_fundamentals
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:** This creates a clean, isolated workspace for this course. It's like having a dedicated lab for your experiments.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:** Install all the tools you'll need with one simple command.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Launch Jupyter:** Open the door to your interactive learning environment.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5.  **Begin Your Journey:** Start with the first notebook in `01-AI_Fundamentals`. Each module contains labs and detailed notes.


Happy learning!
